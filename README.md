# Eventlite Backend Ruby on Rails App

This is an Eventbrite clone, built as part of [The Complete React on Rails course](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/react-rails-course) on [Learnetto](https://learnetto.com) by Hrishi Mittal.

This app provides a full-stack Rails app and the backend Rails API for the [frontend React user interface](https://github.com/learnetto/eventlite-frontend).

## How to run

First, install all the gems:

```
$ bundle
```

Set up the database:

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Start the Rails server on port 3000.

```
$ rails start
```

## Branches for course modules (book chapters)

Each course module (book chapter) has its own branch:

[Module 3 - YOUR FIRST REACT RAILS APP](https://github.com/learnetto/eventlite/tree/module3-your-first-react-rails-app)

[Module 4 - FORMS IN DEPTH](https://github.com/learnetto/eventlite/tree/module4-forms)

[Module 6 - REACT ROUTER](https://github.com/learnetto/eventlite/tree/module6-react-router)

For the later modules, there are no changes in the Rails code. See the [frontend repo](https://github.com/learnetto/eventlite-frontend) for corresponding branches.
